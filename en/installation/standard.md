## Connect the plugin to Isogeo {#authentication}

When you launch the plugin for the very first time or clicking [on the button to change authentication in the settings tab](/usage/configuration.md)), the authentication form is displayed.

Just upload the credentials file `client_secrets.json`you must have received by email from Isogeo.

If you have an Isogeo account (means that you can [log in here](https://id.api.isogeo.com/)), you can check the  `I've got edition rights on app.isogeo.com` option.

_Et voil√† !_ Enjoy!
