# Standard installation

Classic installation process for standard users, through the stable channel of QGIS plugins.

1. In QGIS, check network settings \(proxy...\) opening menu _Settings_ &gt; _Options..._:

3. At the first start, the [authentication form](#auth-form) will be displayed, so enter the credentials you received by mail:

   If you have an Isogeo account (means that you can [log in here](https://id.api.isogeo.com/)), you can check the  `I've got edition rights on app.isogeo.com` option.

_Et voil√† !_ Enjoy!
