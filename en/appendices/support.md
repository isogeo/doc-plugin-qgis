## Report an issue {#report}

If you get an error message or notice unusual behaviour, here's what you can do :

- check in this documentation that the problem encountered has not already been documented ;)

- look at the Isogeo tab in the QGIS message window :

!["Open the QGIS message window"](/assets/qgis_log_view_tab_isogeo_en.png)

If the problem persists, [report it in a new Issue](https://github.com/isogeo/isogeo-plugin-qgis/issues) by clicking on the dedicated button (red megaphone) in the `Settings` tab, attaching :

- a screenshot of the Isogeo tab of the QGIS messages window

- and most importantly the log\_isogeo\_plugin.log file located in the `_logs` folder of the plugin installation folder. To access it, simply click on the dedicated button in the `Settings` tab (to the left of the red megaphone) :

  !["Settings -log and report button"](/assets/settings_resources_en.png)

  You can also access it from the QGIS plugin directory:

  - 3.x plugin version (QGIS 3): `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\python\plugins\isogeo_search_engine\_log` for Windows or `/home/$USER/.local/share/QGIS/QGIS3/profiles/default/python/plugins/isogeo_search_engine/_log` for Ubuntu

  - 1.x plugin version (QGIS 2): `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.qgis2\python\plugins\isogeo_search_engine\_log` for Windows or `/home/$USER/.qgis2/python/plugins/isogeo_search_engine/_log` for Ubuntu
