# Quick searches

## Save a quicksearch

Every search can be saved as a quicksearch in order to be used as a shortcut and save time in regular usage.

The process is simple:

1. When search parameters are active (terms and/or filters), click on save button (at the top left of the results table):

    !["Form to save a quicksearch"](/assets/search_quicksearch_save_button_en.png)

2. Give it a name:

    !["Form to name a quicksearch"](/assets/search_quicksearch_save_popup_en.png)

## Use quick searches

Pick the wanted quicksearch from the drop-down list (bottom right of the search bar):

!["Quicksearch picker"](/assets/search_quicksearch_pick_en.png)
